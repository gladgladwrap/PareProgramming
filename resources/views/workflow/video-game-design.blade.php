	<h2>Environment Design</h2>

	<p>You will need to plan your game's environment and level designs.</p>
	<p>A preproduction blueprint will help you in planning your game's environment design from beginning to end.</p>
	
	<h3>Environment Planning</h3>
	<p>Before opening any graphics editor, make a preproduction blueprint.</p>

	<ol class="my-4">
		<li>Idea. What do you want to create? Write all of your ideas down.</li>
		<li>Purpose. Why do you want to create this environment?</li>
		<li>Features. Make a list of all elements that you want to include in your environment and map.</li>
		<li>Location and environment settings. Where does your game or level take place? What kind of setting?</li>
		<li>Collect photo references for the environment and location you have selected. Look for set design and props, lighting and style, and inspirational reference.</li>
		<li>Create a story for your environment. What happened in the environment prior to the player arriving there?</li>
		<li>Create a story for how your character came to that environment.</li>
		<li>Create objectives. What is the player going to try to acheive?</li>
		<li>Create any obstructions in the environment that your player may face.</li>
		<li>Are there any set pieces? These are scripted events. Set pieces enrich player experience.</li>
		<li>Create a top-down layout of your environment. You will see where structures and obstacles will go, spawn-point positions, objective locations, and the routes your player will navigate.</li>
		<li>Decide if there will be any focal points in your environment. Focal points allow players to orient themselves within an environment and improve the overall aesthetics. Players will gravitate towards these focal points.</li>
		<li>Visual Development. Create the look and aesthetic style of your environment. This will set the mood of the scene. This includes colour palette, architecture, landscape, and scale. </li>
		<li>Plan your production process. List your steps. </li>

	<h3>Drawing Your Environment</h3>

	<p>Now we actually need to draw our environment that we planned in the previous stage. A lot of people get to this stage, or begin here, and are overwhelmed in the decision for a graphics editor. I use Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.</p>

	<h4>Do you require a raster graphic or a vector graphic?</h4>

	<p></p>

	<ol>
		<li>Precompose our image by blocking in our shapes for our scene. Also place our horizon line and vanishing points, obviously.</li>
		<li>Add some highlight subjects in the foreground or middle ground.</li>
		<li>Draw objects in the foreground before those in the background. It is easier to scale the background with foreground elements as reference.</li>
	</ol>
