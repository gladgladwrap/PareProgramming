	<h1>Java Development</h1>

	<p>Java is fun. Getting started, however, is not. Choosing an IDE for Java can be very frustrating if you choose the wrong one. I had been inclined to make the switch from Sublime 2 (a text editor) to Microsoft's Visual Studio Code (an IDE). VS Code supports Java, but I find it to be a much less intuitive workspace. Once I made the switch to Eclipse I found myself more at ease. There are some really good IDE's such as IntelliJ by JetBrains.</p>

	<p>You don't need to know very much code to actually compile and run a java program from the command line:</p>

	<pre>javac example.java </pre>
	<pre>java example.class </pre>
